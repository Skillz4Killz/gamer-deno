## What is the Idle Game?

I'm pretty sure allmost all of you know mobile Idle Games. You upgrade your Items/Buildings in order to produce more money per second. Now you can do this in Discord too! And even with Discord things itself!

## How do I get started?

First off you need to create your profile with `.idle create`

As you progress upgrading your things, you also progress in a story. Yes, it's not just a simple Idle Game - it also got a story to tell!

You can easily check your current Level of things with aswell as how much money you have with `.idle profile`. Also you can see what you can upgrade next once you reached Level 25 of the current part.

With `.idle lb` you can check the current leaderboard. It shows who got the most money and most income per second. It's sorted by the most income per second.

You can increase your income even more if you play the game on multiple servers at once!
