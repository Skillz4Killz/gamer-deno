Can't get enough of the bot? Need even more awesome things? The VIP option enables some of the coolest and most powerful features ever!

**Patreon:** https://www.patreon.com/dligence

There are mainly two types of VIP's in Gamer.
1. VIP Package: More than likely this is what you want.
2. Enterprise Package: If you are a game developer company, you probably want the Enterprise package.

Gamer was designed and developed mainly for official gaming servers. However, it was done in a way that it could be used by any server.

## VIP Package

VIP Package, allows the user to become a VIP user but also be able to grant a server of their choice VIP features.

All VIP tiers on patreon get the same benefits. Each tier just adds an additional server you can grant VIP.

Tier 1: 1 server.
Tier 2: 2 servers etc....

**LIFETIME:** There is a lifetime option of $100. This will grant you a lifetime VIP(for the lifetime of the bots) with a special bot shared with other lifetime servers. To learn more about this come chat with us in the support server.

## VIP User Features

- Provide a custom background url for `.profile`
- Unlock all 5 missions on `.profile`
- Select a different color left side background theme on `.profile`
- Upload custom badges on `.profile`
- Add a custom BIO description on `.profile`

## VIP Server Features

### Mod Mails

- Keep your main server clean and to the point, allow mod mails to be on a staff only private server.
- `tags` can be created that can be sent like copy-pastes for usual questions. If users are asking the same questions, you can create mail tags that are then able to be sent by just 1 word.
- `labels` can be created allowing you to organize mails in different categories. For example, you can apply the `admin` label when a mail needs to be reviewed by an admin. The mail will be moved over to the admin category. Since Discord has a max limit of 50 channels per category, this also allows you to have more than 50 mails. You can move any pending mails to a different category using this feature.
- `silent` can be used to close a mail silently. This will not alert the user that their mail has been closed. It will still be shown in the private mail logs.
- `autoresponse` can be used to set up a message that is automatically sent to the user when they initially send a message. When users send a mail, you can create a autoresponse to send like Thank you for contacting us. This is an automated response. I have @ the team. They will respond as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you feel you need to send more information, feel free to use the mail command below to send more messages.
- Reply to a mail anonymously.
- Create a Q&A session where you set certain questions that users need to respond to before they can send a mail. Once the user has responded to them you will get a mail. For example:

What is your in game name?
What is your player ID?
What is the device that you play on?
What server is your account on?
Which country are you located in?
How can we help you?

### Feedback

- Customize the rejected message. This message is sent to the user whenever a feedback is "rejected" by a mod/admin.
- Customize the solved message. This message is sent to the user whenever a feedback is "solved" by a mod/admin.
- Allows the customization of questions. You can add or remove questions.
  - Choose whether you would like the user to respond via reactions to choose an option or a text response
  - Choose some filters that can help restrict certain types of responses and validate them. For example, if you only want a 1 word response or you want a number.
- Export feedback into CSV format.
- Set the approval channel queue to be on a different private staff only server.
- Set the log channel queue to be on a different private staff only server.
- Set the rejected channel queue to be on a different private staff only server.
- Set the solved channel queue to be on a different private staff only server.

### Spy

- Allows you to monitor when certain words are stated. For example, if someone types your name instead of @. Or if you want to be alerted whenever someone mentions `lag` or `bug` for your game.

### Role Manager

- `all` Assign/remove a role to/from all members on the server.
- `list` Get a full list of all roles and their ids.
- `members` Review which users have which roles.
- `Unique Role Sets` These role sets allow you to make sure a user can only have 1 role in this set of roles. If you have more than 1 role in this set, they will be removed so you can only keep 1.
- `Required Role Sets` These role sets allow you to set a required role in order to gain any role in this set. For example, if you have the NA, EU, SA roles but you want to make sure that users can not get any of these roles unless they also have the Verified role. This is what required role sets are for.
- `Grouped Role Sets` These role sets allow you to automatically give other roles when the user gains a role. For example, if the user is granted a Booster role on your server you might also want to add other roles like VIP.
- `Default Role Sets` These role sets allow you to make sure that the user always has some role from this set. For example, if you have a set of roles of NA, EU, SA you can set the default role to UNVERIFIED. This way if the user does not have any of the 3 roles, they are given the UNVERIFIED role.
- `Role Messages` Send a custom message whenever a user gains or loses a role. For example, you can leave instructions or just another welcome message for unlocking a new role.
- `Reaction Role Color Wheel` Automatically creates a reaction role for you where users can select one of 20 colors but can only have 1 color role at any time.
- Per VIP user request, you can now choose your own Muted role instead of having the bot create one. BE WARNED! THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. ADVANCED USERS ONLY!
