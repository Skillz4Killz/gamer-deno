## Vision

To provide the best discord experience for game developers and gamers on Official Gaming Servers!

## Mission

*Gamer Speaking*:
I want to be the very best!
Like no one ever was!
To stay online 24/7 is my real test!
To moderate the servers is my cause!
I will join servers across the land.
