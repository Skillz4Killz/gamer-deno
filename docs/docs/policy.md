WIP:

By having any of our bots in your server, you are consenting to the use of these random Discord generated ids.

The only data we will ever save are the settings commands that you will choose to save. For example, when you create a welcome message, we store the message so that when a user joins we can send that message. Another example, when you save words to be automoderated by gamer, those words are saved so we can know which words to filter.

We do not store any content without your express permission. Majority of the settings are usually either just toggles of on or off, they can be id like channel ids, role ids or user ids. Very few settings will ever save data. Certain other commands will also save information, for example, the events, afk commands save your message you want saved.
It is important that you know that if you wish to remove any data that we save, there is a simple command available .reset If this command is ran on your server, the bot will remove all data related to your server. If this command is ran in a private message(dm) with the bot, it will remove all data for your account. Note however, it will not delete guild data related to your account such as your mod logs, or other information that the guild saves for your account. Type .help reset to learn how in more details.

**IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME, DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME BY SENDING ME A PRIVATE MESSAGE. MY DMS WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN FOR THIS SERVER!**
