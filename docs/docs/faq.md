## Is there a dashboard to set up the bot in my own server?

Nah. I am waiting for Discord's new bot features. They are going to allow me to build the dashboard right inside discord.

Once this is released I can use it to build a dashboard where you can create your configs right inside discord.

I'm not really a good web developer so I haven't built a dashboard. I prefer backend server side coding.

## Is there a list of commands available?

A list of commands is shown here on our website. You can also use the search feature here to find anything you like. For example, want to see if there is a way to change your prefix, search for prefix and you will find the prefix command.

## Is the server logo keep changing or am I crazy?

Yes. The logo does indeed change. It is being done by @Animator bot. It was a dumb idea I had at one moment and I thought it would be impossible. I challenged myself to do it and here we are.

**The Idea:** If a server logo rotates and changes every so often users will be curious whats going on in that server and come chat in your server, probably what brought you here reading this 😜 Basically increases server activity.

To try it out on your server invite the bot with `%invite` command.

Setup On Your Server: Once the bot is invited, please make a channel which the bot can read called `server-logos` for example `#server-logos` . The name MUST be exact. You can keep it private or let any user post images but please make sure the bot has access to it. The bot will pick 1 out of the last 100 messages and will give your server a new logo!
