## Mod Mails

The mod mail has been reworked and cleaned up. A couple cool aspects added in but an insane level of customizability provided for VIPs

1. To setup: .settings mails setup
This will create a base for you to work with. Highly recommended
a. It will create a mail category inbox for u
b. it will create a mail-alert role for u that u can assign to mods who need to be pinged
feel free to delete and customize this role later
c. creates a mail-logs channel for logging/archiving all ur mail history since channels in mails are deleted
d. creates a ratings channel where users who give ur support a rating will be sent
Useful for learning which users are satisfied and which were not and learn to improve ur support team for ur server to make all users happy and satisfied
Other settings:
.settings mails roles roleID roleID roleID to select which roles to @  when a mail arrives
.settings mails enable
.settings mails disable

VIP ONLY .settings mails autoresponse When users send a mail, you can create a autoresponse to send like Thank you for contacting us. This is an automated response. I have @ the team. They will respond as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you feel you need to send more information, feel free to use the mail command below to send more messages.

New Settings Experiment:

One of the things we are testing with this update is using channel topics as settings for the bot. This means we store less data about your server for your privacy concerns but also helps decrease our costs.
To set a channel as the channel you want to use for these experimental settings, for example mail-logs where you want mails sent, all you need to do is edit the channel topic
The keywords for channels are as follow:
gamerMailLogChannel
gamerMailRatingChannel
gamerSupportChannel  The mod mail support channel

Aiky/Dys please give me feedback on this. Should we rename? We should decide on a nice pattern so we keep that going forward.

gamerMailLogChannel or gamer-mail-log-channel or do we even need gamer mail-log-channel
Need to think it through or should we do gmlc for example
%gmlc%

VIP ONLY: Mod mails now allow you to be able to create a Q&A session where you set certain questions that users need to respond to before they can send a mail. Only once the user has responded to them you will get a mail
When you do .settings mails setup gamer creates some gaming based questions as a default for you. The questions are as follow
- What is your in game name?
- What is your player ID?
- What is the device that you play on?
- What server is your account on?
- Which country are you located in?
- How can we help you?
In order to add or remove questions you will use the command as follow
.settings mails questions add
.settings mails questions remove
This will begin a small Q&A session to help you add or remove the questions.
First thing is whether you want the user to respond by typing a message or to answer your question based on a reaction. For example, some questions like What is your in game name? can be different for every user. For this you would want to use the message type. But for questions like, what server is your account on? You can limit it to specific options like NA, EU, SA, EA, etc... Then users will be able to select one of them by tapping a reaction
The second thing you will be asked it to provide the question.
Then a label. This label is important as this is what you will use to remove a question. It will also be shown in your mails channels. For example, if the question is What is your in-game name? You can create a label called In-Game Name: Then in your mail you will get a mail that uses that label.

![label](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/746499440981966988/751204312520327288/unknown.png)

Lastly, you must decide what type of response you want
Do you want a 1 word string, multiple words allowed, a number
--
If you chose the reaction option, you need to provide the question, label and the options
When the bot asks you for the options they must be provided by splitting them with  |
For example:
NA | EU | SA | SEA | EA | CN
VIP FEATURE: Replying to mails anonymously. Sometimes you don't want to respond and give your name to a mail. Sometimes, you may wish to reply on the behalf of the entire team. To do this you can reply using

.mail reply anonymous (your response to the user here without the ())
VIP FEATURE: On occassion, you may wish to silently close a mail without the user being alerted. To do this .mail silent (the reason to add to the logs without the ())
VIP FEATURE: One of the coolest things about the new mod mails is it's ability to be handled on a separate server!!!  If you want to do this, you can do .settings mail setup OTHER_GUILD_ID For examples, if you manage multiple servers and you want to keep the support team in one place now you can! This will also help keep your main server clean and allow your team to mute the main server but keep notifications on for the support server so they can be on alert for important things in order for your users to have the best quality support possible.
