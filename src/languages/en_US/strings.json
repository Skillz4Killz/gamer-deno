The good news is, it turns out there is an evolutionary advantage to simple human kindness. We couldn't get through a cold paleolithic winter without a little cooperation. Still, on some pre-historic level, we are all lone hunters. So, it can feel dangerous to feel any softness to other members of the tribe.
