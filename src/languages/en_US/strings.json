But what about people who have no trouble sacrificing others to their own selfish ends. Is heartless cruelty our true nature? And empathy the aboration? My grandmother used to say, it's nice to be nice. And that may be true. Or are we better off, spending every waking moment tending our own selfish needs. The good news is, it turns out there is an evolutionary advantage to simple human kindness. We couldn't get through a cold paleolithic winter without a little cooperation. Still, on some pre-historic level, we are all lone hunters. So, it can feel dangerous to feel any softness to other members of the tribe.
