My grandmother used to say, it's nice to be nice. And that may be true. Or are we better off, spending every waking moment tending our own selfish needs. The good news is, it turns out there is an evolutionary advantage to simple human kindness. We couldn't get through a cold paleolithic winter without a little cooperation.
